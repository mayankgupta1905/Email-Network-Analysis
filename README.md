Enron Corporation was an American energy, commodities, and services company. The dataset contains 143 employees of the company as nodes and links between them show that an email communication took place between the employees.

The aim of this project is to analyze the network and report various key metrics for the network such as:-
* Clustering coefficient
* Central and periphery nodes
* Connected components (if any) and type 
* Node and link connectivities
* Network centrality
* Communities in the network

These metrics summarize the network to understand, key nodes in the network and overall spread and behaviour of the network. The dataset can be found at <a href="http://networkrepository.com/email-enron-only.php">Link</a>.
